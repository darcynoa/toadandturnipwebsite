_Noah D'Arcy's boilerplate for all web projects._

# NextJS BoilerPlate

This boiler plate uses the latest version of [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), and uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

Animations are all powered by [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) including the page transitions!

**More integrations for CMS coming soon...**
